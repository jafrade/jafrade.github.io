    <div class="lightDescr">
    	<p>The goal of this project was to make the game of hyper milling easier for both the newcomer's of the Toyota Prius and also keep it just as understandable to the veteran's of the game. This project was a team effort, through the course of the project we took an idea and ran with it. We went through our first lo-fi wireframe and did some usability testing where we found somethings needed fixing and finally finished with a polished design and an easy to use system.

    <h4>UX/UI</h4>
    
    <div class="lightDescr">
    	<p>The goal of this project was to create a mobile application that would help freelancers better record the time they spent on a project. I started my thought process with sketched roughs (that are not included here) then continued onto making a blueprint to map out the sites structure. Next I created a lo-wireframe and conducted a usability test. From the testing I took the suggestions from my user's and created a final layout.</p>
